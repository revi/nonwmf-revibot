## Revibot for non-WMF wikis

This is the configurations for the revibots running outside wikimedia wikis.

Each farm (currently [femiwiki](https://femiwiki.com) and [Miraheze](https://meta.miraheze.org)) has their own pywikibot directory, own user-config file, and crontab entry.

Report bugs by sending an email to [revibot-support](mailto:revibot-support@revi.email).
